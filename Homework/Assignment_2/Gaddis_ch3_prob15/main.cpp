Write a program that can be used as a math tutor for a young student. The program
should display two random numbers to be added, such as
  247
+ 129
The program should then pause while the student works on the problem. When the
student is ready to check the answer, he or she can press a key and the program will
display the correct solution:
  247
+ 129
  376
