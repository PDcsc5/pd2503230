 * Assuming there are no deposits other than the original investment, the balance in a
savings account after one year may be calculated as
Principal is the balance in the savings account,  Rate is the interest rate, and  T is the
number of times the interest is compounded during a year ( T is 4 if the interest is com-
pounded quarterly).
Write a program that asks for the principal, the interest rate, and the number of times
the interest is compounded. It should display a report similar to
Interest Rate: 4.25%
Times Compounded: 12
Principal: $ 1000.00
Interest: $ 43.34
Amount in Savings: $ 1043.34
